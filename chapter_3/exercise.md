[code-part-b](./exercise3_1b.cpp)

## 3.2

> Write a program to read the standard input a line at a time. Modify your program to read a word at a time.

[code-part-b](./exercise3_2b.cpp)

## 3.3

> Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string input op- erator and in the getline function.

- The string input operator reads and discards any leading whitespace (e.g., spaces, newlines, tabs). It then reads characters until the next whitespace character is encountered.
- This function reads the given stream up to and including the first newline and stores what it read—not including the newline—in its string argument.

## 3.4

> Write a program to read two strings and report whether the strings are equal. If not, report which of the two is larger. Now, change the program to report whether the strings have the same length, and if not, report which is longer.
